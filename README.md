**Recommended Services for Ubuntu Server**

This document provides a curated list of services commonly installed on Ubuntu servers. You can choose the services that best suit your server's needs.

**Before Installation:**

**Update and Upgrade Ubuntu:**
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Run the following commands to ensure you have the latest packages:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```

**Installation**
    - To install the rest of the application
    - Run the following commands:

     ```bash
     sudo chmod +x main.sh
     ./main.sh
     ```        

**Security Considerations:**

- **Firewalls:** Configure a firewall (e.g., UFW) to restrict access to only necessary ports for installed services.
- **Strong Passwords:** Use strong passwords for all accounts, especially for database and server administration.

**Remember:**

- Choose services that align with your server's purpose. 
- Keep your server updated and secure.
- Consult the official documentation for detailed configuration steps.
